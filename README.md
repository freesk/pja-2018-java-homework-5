Object-oriented programming in Java homework 5

The project shows an example of dumping the current state of a simple program into a file with a way to reinitializing the state from it

I thought it would be cooler to store information about all classes in a single file. Besides, the way I made it has given me a little bit of practice in dynamic initialization. Why not if they all inherit from Vehicle after all? Speaking of data.txt formatting, I would rather go with JSON but the requirement seemed to be quite specific about formatting. My formatting is not an exact match since I have a bit different classes
